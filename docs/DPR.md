- Doctor & treatment management (CRUD)
- Appointment booking with real-time slot conflict checking
- Online payments (Razorpay)
- Real-time chat & video (Socket.io)
- E-prescriptions, reviews, dashboard
- AI symptom checker (Gemini)
- Responsive, accessible UI
- Automated/manual testing

## 4. System Design
